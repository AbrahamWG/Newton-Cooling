Hello! ‚úãüèª

This is a fun school project me and my friends build for our physics class. It's a calculator to determine a victim's death time according to the room's temperature and the body's temperature. The formula was invented by Isaac Newton. 

For starters, this program requires flask to be installed. 

`python3 -m pip install flask`

To run the program:

`python3 -m flask run`

Have fun!
